I had an idea that maybe the whole app could be based around one really cool UI element that dynamically changes based upon user input. Probably utilizing react-router and some other library that makes cool stuff. Just an idea.

Sort of like a jumbotron or a hero UI element, but it dynamically displays the API data as comparison of different currencies. Maybe it also pulls from something like the Wikipedia API to display pertinent information about the currency chosen by the user.
